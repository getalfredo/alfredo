![Remote install](../../../assets/Remote+install.png)

This is the developer documentation, based on the outline of the project.

It acts as a guide to understand how the project works, and how to contribute to it.

Alfredo is a self-hosting assistant that helps you to install applications on your server.

It lives in its own world (can be outside but also on the same server), and it remotely installs applications on your server.

We will now follow the Outline of the project to understand how it works.

# Application

## Dashboard

- We will see overall stats of the servers, applications, and spaces. Alerts as well.

## Credentials

- We manage API keys and tokens for provisioning servers.

Features
- [x] We can add an API key for Hetzner, AWS, Digital Ocean, etc.
- [x] We can add SSH keys for the servers we manage.
  - [x] We can also generate on the fly.

## Servers Page

- Manage our inventory of servers

Features
- [ ] Deploy server. This option connects to the Provider and creates a new server.
- [ ] Add existing server. This option adds server information to the database, so we can connect to it.


### Spaces

- On a default server, we have an `alfredo` user.

In `/home/alfredo/spaces/myblog` => git
In `/home/alfredo/spaces/analytics` => umami
In `/home/alfredo/spaces/error-tracking` => sentry/glitchtip

- Each workspace is a folder with a name, and it contains the following:
    - `alfredo.yaml` file
    - `repo` folder
    - `builds` binary
    - `data` config file
    - `stack` compose project
