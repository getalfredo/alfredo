After trying out a local virtualization tool (Multipass), we decided to use a real cloud vps for the tests.

They charge by the hour, and it will be feasible to run the tests on a real cloud vps.

We might come back to this topic in the future, maybe with VirtualBox or Proxmox, but for now, a cloud VPS will deo.
